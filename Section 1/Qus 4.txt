It is a measure of the rate of decrease in the intensity of electromagnetic radiation (x-rays or gamma rays) as it passes through a given substance(matter) the fraction of incident radiant energy absorbed per unit mass or thickness of an absorber.
I=Io exp(-u*t)
where u is absorption coefficient
I is (reduced)intensity
Io is incident intensity
