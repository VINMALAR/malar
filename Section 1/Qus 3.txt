The image processing technique is used to enhance raw images received from cameras(or)sensors by removing noise and any kind of irregularities.
The image classification carries the image processing step further and attempts to replace the visual interpretation step with quantitative decision making.
The image classification techniques are
                        1.Support vector machines
                        2.Spectral-Spatial method
                        3.Pixel-wise method
                        4.Spectral band ratios
